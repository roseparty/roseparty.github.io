        <h2>Press Release: Clarifying a Myth</h2>
        <h3>Why Bob Skibadi is the Best Candidate for You</h3>
        <p>
            Bob Skibadi truly cares. He wants only the best for the good people of our country, like you! He will make our economy stronger and provide a brighter future for our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bob Skibadi will make efforts to strengthen the economy, institute the best education in the world, minimize our countryâ€™s carbon output, provide free healthcare for all, ensure the safety of all citizens, and protect our citizens' rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bob Skibadi was raised in the state of Virginia, in a low income family. Throughout his childhood, Skibadi worked diligently to exceed the expectations of his educators, peers, and even his own family. Skibadi persisted to overcome bigotry surrounding his Hispanic heritage, and excelled in academics and athletics. He went on to earn a full scholarship to Harvard, where he earned his Juris Doctor and later his Master of Laws. After graduating, he became a cabinet member from 2008-2012, and is currently the governor of Virginia, a position he has held since 2018.

            Recently, Bob Skibadi has been accused of using steroids to enhance his appearance. The truth is not that Bob Skibadi used steroids of his own accord, but that he was unknowingly drugged with them. When Bob Skibadi was a highschool student, he played on an unsuccessful rugby team; after a season of losses, his rugby coach decided to drug the teamâ€™s drinks with anabolic steroids. Bob Skibadi and his rugby teammates were unknowing victims of a selfish adultâ€™s greed. Though Bob Skibadi was stricken upon discovering that he had been drugged, he now feels that without this experience, he would not be the person he is today. This experience was unique in that it gave him lots of perspective on how it feels to be manipulated and falsely accused of a crime. Thus, Skibadi has no shame about being a victim of exploitation, and is public about how experiences like his should be prevented.
        </p>
        <p>
            Skibadiâ€™s unique upbringing and obstacles to his goals has made him into a strong candidate focused on human rights, as well as eliminating inequality and discrimination.
