                The Rose Party is one of the 8th-grade political parties which is focused heavily on the defense of environment and economy of the American people. Our rose represents our heart with its beautiful petals, and our bold and strong resolve, firm, undisturbed with its sharp thorns. This sums up the goals of the Rose Party as well; empathy and defense with no comprimise in either. No matter the cost, we will protect people’s rights by not just adressing crime spikes and rising taxes, but taking action. While also protecting the balance of nature and working towards fixing the issues that are global warming and climate change. We will not gatekeep everything for ourselves only to address the issues we face, but the issues we as a country face together. We will stand strong when others are hopeless and look to selflessness and help everyone, above all else.
