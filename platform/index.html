            <p>
                As the Rose Party, we strongly believe in defending our nation. We will accomplish this by implementing serious improvements in Healthcare, Economy, Environment, Social Justice, Education, Foreign Policy, and Immigration. Our main focuses include reducing the cost of healthcare and living for all people in the United States, advancing the education system, and adjusting inflation to improve the economy.

            <h2>Social Justice</h2>
        </div>
        <span class="platformText">
            <p>
                For our party, Social Justice is a very important plank. Our goal is to improve laws on topics such as criminal rights in/after prison, gun restrictions, drinking, drug use, and housing. We will improve the rights of minor criminals after they are released from incarceration, by passing policies prohibiting workplace discrimination based on a minor crime in criminal records. We believe able people should have the potential to contribute to society, which isn’t currently possible due to people essentially being unable to resume a normal life after being jailed. 
So much unnecessary violence has occurred in our country due to guns getting in the wrong hands. To protect everyone, and especially our children, we will require strict background checks and training to obtain a gun license. Additionally, if a gun owner misuses or threatens to misuse their gun, it will be taken away, along with their license.
The NHTSA has stated that almost a third of young drivers killed in fatal crashes involved underage drinking. We aim to better educate minors on how to be safe around alcohol, and enable children to make healthy choices. We will impose stricter regulations on pregnancy and drinking. We will also pass a policy so that if an individual abuses alcohol more than once, their ID will be marked so they may not purchase more. 
We discourage hard drugs for minors, and will provide rehabilitation centers nationwide for anyone who has overdosed or is addicted to hard drugs. Rehabilitation centers will have three specialist groups; Hallucinatory help, Addiction help and Overdose help. This will have an easily recognizable line that anyone will be able to access and call for aid.
All individuals or groups will be able to express who they are in a positive way as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others. We will also continue to build affordable housing to get people off the streets. 
Our goal is to make communities safer and connected, and further unite the people of The United States of America.

            <h2>Education</h2>
        </div>
        <span class="platformText">
            <p>
                We believe that education is a right, not a privilege, and all children should be able to attend school and have a safe space to learn without having to worry about personal issues such as funds. The current education system has fundamental flaws, and we aim to significantly improve the effectiveness of teaching. We will strive to drastically increase staff hiring and funds for schools and extracurriculars, so that teachers have better resources to teach with, and teacher to student ratios are improved. The current education system leaves many adults unprepared for their lives, with the United States having one of the worst literacy rates for a country with its level of development. 55 percent of adults in the United States have a literacy rate of below a sixth grade level. There is also a large dropoff in literacy for women and people living in poverty, which is unacceptable on a moral and humanitarian level.  Children are our nation’s future, and they should get the education they deserve and need—as should any adult who has not completed a full education or wishes to increase their level of knowledge.

            <p>
                Our party agrees that a strong economy is essential for a greater, more equal United States. This is why we will decrease taxes for the lower class, and increase them for the upper class, adjusting where necessary to combat inflation. We will also raise the minimum wage to be equal to the living wage, provide tax deductions and minimal government funding for small business startups, and invest in other measures to control inflation. Additionally, we will redirect funding from places such as the military into education, healthcare, energy, safe environmentally-friendly transport, and more. The military exists now, but climate change will affect the world indefinitely.

        <span class="platformText">
            <p>
                Our party believes in affordable healthcare (including menstrual products, insulin, and vital prescription drugs), and longer maternity/paternity leave times. We will supply free healthcare necessities to individuals in need, such as seniors and impoverished veterans, houseless people, and disabled people. We aim to reinstate Roe V. Wade to give women rights over their own bodies,  and improve Medicaid to be more effective and easily attainable. It is important to our party to promote awareness about eating disorders and discrimination in the distribution of healthcare necessities to communities in need. Our goal is to create a healthcare system devoid of prejudice.

            <p>
                We promise to build a better future for the environment of our planet. Our goal is to cut down on the use of unsustainable and finite energy sources. Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and other unrenewable sources of energy can be unreliable, devastating for the environment, and will eventually run out. If current usage rates continue, we wll run out of coal by the year 2168, and oil as soon as the year 2052. If this doesn’t change soon, our dependency on fossil fuels will increase, which will also increase our usage of unrenewable fuel sources, making us run out even sooner. We will prioritize investing in and building items that harness renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. We will tax companies using unreliable power sources to pay for other matters that would preserve the environment on a global scale, and help the communities most at risk.

                The Rose Party believes that the United States should prioritize improving and establishing relationships with other political entities, whether states, unions, or international entities to assist in the establishment of a peaceful world. We believe that providing military aid to any party involved in a war will only cause more damage to all parties and prolong the conflict unnecessarily. Instead, we will provide humanitarian aid to any affected individuals and work on helping involved parties reach a peaceful resolution.

            <p>
                Our goal with immigration as a party is to improve the immigration system by securing the border and making sure the immigration system is more efficient, so that people that wish to enter the United States can enter legally, with the ability to vote, and with all rights that a human being should have. We also aim to better inform the public of the United States on the exact process an immigrant goes through and how to support them as much as possible to grow and strengthen the community. This will make the country safer for the people in it and those around the country, regardless of where they come from, who they are, and what their story is, because every person deserves a chance. We will achieve this by increasing resources for the USCIS to speed up and improve the immigration process, processing people who are currently undocumented to grant them citizenship and the rights that come with it, funding social programs to inform the current population about how to support immigrants, and providing jobs for new immigrants in a variety of fields.
